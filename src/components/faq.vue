                    People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by

                    target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19

                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends
                    and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where
                    COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                    disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for
                    example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people

                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of
                    people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a
                    lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                    blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip
                    that spreads rumors and myths.

                  <p>
                    Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards
                    ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the
                    problem.

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                    person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently
                    there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                    associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is
                    important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                    your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                    going to the bathroom.

                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                    touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
                    then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                    but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                    spreads.

                    In general, because of poor survivability of these
                    coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of
                    spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over
                    a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or
                    frozen temperatures.

                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness,
                    and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                    symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                    become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't
                    feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                    disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                    develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
                    problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious
                    illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing
                    should seek medical attention.

                    This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but
                    so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in
                    children. Most illness, including serious illness, is
                    happening in adults of working age and older adults. If
                    there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the
                    school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals
                    in your community. Read or watch local media sources that
                    report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed
                    temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if

                    classroom assignments and activities they can do from home
                    to keep up with their schoolwork.

                    there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19

                    important to always wash your hands with soap and water for
                    20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash
                    your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or

                    No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.
                    To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should
                    frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub
                    or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are
                    cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper
                    towels or a warm air dryer.
